        <ol>
          <li>
            Cook the Spaghetti
            <ul>
              <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the spaghetti and cook according to the package
                instructions until al dente. Reserve about 1 cup of the pasta cooking water before draining.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Prepare the Pancetta
            <ul>
              <li>While the pasta is cooking, heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add the diced pancetta or guanciale
                and
                cook until it becomes crispy and browned, about 5-7 minutes. Add the whole garlic cloves to the skillet
                for added flavor.
                Once the pancetta is done, remove and discard the garlic.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Make the Egg and Cheese Mixture
            <ul>
              <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the eggs, Pecorino Romano, and Parmigiano-Reggiano cheeses. Season
                with
                a generous
                amount of freshly ground black pepper.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Combine Ingredients
            <ul>
              <li>Add the cooked and drained spaghetti to the skillet with the pancetta. Toss well to coat the pasta in
                the rendered fat.
                Remove the skillet from the heat.</li>
              <li>Pour the egg and cheese mixture over the hot pasta, tossing quickly to ensure the eggs donâ€™t scramble.
                The residual heat
                from the pasta will cook the eggs and create a creamy sauce. If the sauce is too thick, add a small
                amount
                of the
                reserved pasta cooking water to achieve the desired consistency.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Serve
            <ul>
              <li>Divide the pasta among plates or bowls. Garnish with additional grated cheese, more black pepper, and
                chopped parsley if
                desired. Serve immediately.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>
