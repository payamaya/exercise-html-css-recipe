      <h3>Instruction</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Cook the Spaghetti</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the spaghetti and cook according to the package
            instructions until al
            dente. Reserve about 1 cup of the pasta cooking water before draining.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>repare the Pancetta:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>While the pasta is cooking, heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add the diced pancetta or guanciale and
            cook until it
            becomes crispy and browned, about 5-7 minutes. Add the whole garlic cloves to the skillet for added flavor.
            Once the
            pancetta is done, remove and discard the garlic.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Make the Egg and Cheese Mixture:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the eggs, Pecorino Romano, and Parmigiano-Reggiano cheeses. Season with a
            generous
            amount of freshly ground black pepper.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Combine Ingredients:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Add the cooked and drained spaghetti to the skillet with the pancetta. Toss well to coat the pasta in the
            rendered fat.
            Remove the skillet from the heat.</li>
          <li>Pour the egg and cheese mixture over the hot pasta, tossing quickly to ensure the eggs donâ€™t scramble. The
            residual heat
            from the pasta will cook the eggs and create a creamy sauce. If the sauce is too thick, add a small amount
            of the
            reserved pasta cooking water to achieve the desired consistency.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Serve:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Divide the pasta among plates or bowls. Garnish with additional grated cheese, more black pepper, and
            chopped parsley if
            desired. Serve immediately.</li>
        </ul>
      </ol>
