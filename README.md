# Instruction for Spaghetti Carbonara

[Home](index.html) [Instruction](intruction.html)

Spaghetti Carbonara is a beloved Italian dish for its rich, creamy texture and savory flavor. The combination of crispy pancetta, silky egg and cheese sauce, and perfectly cooked pasta creates a comforting and satisfying meal. It's quick to make with simple ingredients, making it perfect for a delicious weeknight dinner. The balance of salty, cheesy, and peppery notes appeals to many palates, offering a taste of authentic Italian cuisine that is both hearty and indulgent.
1. Cook the Spaghetti
- Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the spaghetti and cook according to the package instructions until al dente. Reserve about 1 cup of the pasta cooking water before draining.
2. Prepare the Pancetta
- While the pasta is cooking, heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add the diced pancetta or guanciale and cook until it becomes crispy and browned, about 5-7 minutes. Add the whole garlic cloves to the skillet for added flavor. Once the pancetta is done, remove and discard the garlic.
3. Make the Egg and Cheese Mixture
- In a medium bowl, whisk together the eggs, Pecorino Romano, and Parmigiano-Reggiano cheeses. Season with a generous amount of freshly ground black pepper.
Combine Ingredients
- Add the cooked and drained spaghetti to the skillet with the pancetta. Toss well to coat the pasta in the rendered fat. Remove the skillet from the heat.
- Pour the egg and cheese mixture over the hot pasta, tossing quickly to ensure the eggs donâ€™t scramble. The residual heat from the pasta will cook the eggs and create a creamy sauce. If the sauce is too thick, add a small amount of the reserved pasta cooking water to achieve the desired consistency.
5. Serve
- Divide the pasta among plates or bowls. Garnish with additional grated cheese, more black pepper, and chopped parsley if desired. Serve immediately.
